#This is an AI Problem Solver for Wumpus Problem

# 🧠 Wumpus World AI

An intelligent agent that plays the classic **Wumpus World** game using Artificial Intelligence. The agent uses logic-based inference to navigate the cave, avoid pits and the Wumpus, and find the gold!

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Logic-based knowledge representation
- ✅ Perception-based decision making (stench, breeze, glitter, bump, scream)
- ✅ Safe path navigation
- ✅ Wumpus and pit avoidance
- ✅ Goal-seeking behavior (gold collection and escape)

## 🧩 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- AI Search Algorithms (DFS, BFS, A*)
- Propositional Logic / Inference Engine
- Optional: Pygame for visualization

## 📁 Project Structure


## 🧠 AI Logic

The agent uses:

- **Percept-based reasoning** to update its knowledge base.
- **Forward chaining** to infer safe/unvisited cells.
- **Search algorithms** to find optimal paths.

## 🕹️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-wumpus-solver.git
   conda activate venv/
   python wumpus.ipynb
